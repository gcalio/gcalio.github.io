<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Giulia Calio and I'm a 29-year-old living in London, UK.</p>

<p>I am a highly motivated and dynamic individual, focused on details and quick learner. 
  I have a background in PR and Communication and Iâ€™m currently developing my skills in Administration, 
  working on an Executive Assistant Diploma at the Lewis College. 
  I have a good knowledge of Social Media platforms, and my customer support experience helped me to boost my problem solving and multi-tasking skills.</p>

<p>I have always had a big passion for computers and one of my biggest regret is not choosing this major for my studies. However, 
  I believe it is not too late to follow your dreams so here I am self-learning web development! Please have a look at my projects and get in touch!</p>
