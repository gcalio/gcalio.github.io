<h1>The Best Movies According to Giulia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>I believe this is one of the biggest classic and Speilber delivers a masterpiece with his first movie of the saga. I wouldn't be surpise if a lot of kids watching this when they were young wanted to become a paleontologist like me.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This movie is simply so mesmerising and the cast gives an amazing perfomance. It's one of those movies you need to watch multiple times to fully understand the director's view but you wouldn't mind watching it again and again</p>
<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>It might be the nerdy part of me, but Avengers Endgame is a complete other level of Marvel/superheroes movies. It created a lot of expectations and delivered it!</p>
